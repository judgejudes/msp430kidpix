# KidPix--but with a MSP430 and a computer mouse

This is an unintuitive drawing tool using an msp430!

<br> I was inspired by KidPix to create a similar tool--what would that look like?
As a perfectionist, I remember as a kid feeling almost liberated by KidPix's decisions to give users limited control, so I tried my best to mimic that release for me. I love messiness in art, and am convinced great art can be "chaotic" and messy if it means it is more authentic.

(update: KidPix 2.0 was then created using p5.js!)
